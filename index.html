                Welcome to the guessing game. We will generate a number for you
                between 1 and 100. As soon as you hit the "play" button, you
                will have 10 seconds to make a guess. Guess correctly to win.
                If you guess incorrectly, we will tell you if your guess was
                too high or too low and you will lose a life. You only have
                7 lives. If you wait too long, you will lose a life. If you
                lose all your lives, it's game over.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can exit the game at any time by clicking on the Exit Game
                button. Exiting the game will close this tab in your browser.
                You can also restart the game at any time by clicking on the
                Restart Game button.
